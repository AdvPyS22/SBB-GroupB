# SBB-GroupB
SBB data analysis 
# introduction
We analyze the SBB dataset and create the code that users can use directly to get what they want, like if they can enter a station name, then they run the code, they will get all the clock statistics information. Also, users can dynamically select which information to plot and enter new information in the databases.  

# Usage
1. explore clock information
- Download the zip file. Decompressing the file. Enter  **sbb-task1** file. Open the **sbb-task1.py** file. And run it. 
- You will be asked to input the station name and you will get the statistics information, a pdf file(named 'input name'-output.pdf),about clock. Don't care about capitalization and spaces before and after characters of the name.  
For example, if you are interested in 'bern' station clock information. You can input 'Bern' '  BERN' or "BERn'. Then you will get a pdf file, called **Bern-output.pdf**, which shows you statistics information about clock.
2. explore ramps/stairs information
- Enter the **sbb-task2** file. Open the **sbb-task2.py** file. And run it.
- When you run the code, you will get a pie plot that shows ramps/stairs information. Also in order to users explore the data conveniently, you can copy the print text.
- Next step, enter the information you are interested in. And choose the result's type. We offer three different waysï¼Œ'pie', 'bar' or 'all', to show the result.
